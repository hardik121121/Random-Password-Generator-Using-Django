**Random Password Generator**  

This project is a **Random Password Generator** built using **Django**. The application allows users to generate secure and random passwords based on a specified length.  

### Features:  
1. **Customizable Length**: Users can specify the desired length of the password.  
2. **Secure and Randomized**: The generator uses a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to ensure strong passwords.  
3. **Simple and Efficient**: The program is easy to use and generates passwords instantly.  

### How It Works:  
1. The user inputs the desired password length.  
2. The application uses Python's `random` module to select a random set of characters from a predefined pool containing:  
   - Uppercase letters  
   - Lowercase letters  
   - Numbers  
   - Special characters  

3. A password is generated and displayed to the user.  

### Example:  
- Input: `12`  
- Output: `Your Password is: aB3!fG@1$kM2`  

### Getting Started:  
1. Clone or download the project repository.  
2. Set up the Django environment.  
3. Run the server and access the password generator through the web interface.
